1. Open the folder where the file (data.xlsx) you want to upload to Amazon S3 is located.
2. Open Windows PowerShell.
3. Create a new S3 bucket using the following command:
-> aws s3 mb s3://4demo0608
4. Create a Python script named upload.py in the same folder and edit the bucket name, file name and s3 key name.

Code:-
import boto3

def upload_to_s3(bucket_name, file_name, s3_key):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    try:
        s3.upload_file(file_name, bucket_name, s3_key)
        print("File uploaded successfully to S3")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("The file was not found")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")

bucket_name = '4demo0608'
file_name = 'data.xlsx'
s3_key = 'UploadedData.xlsx'

upload_to_s3(bucket_name, file_name, s3_key)

5. Run the Python script.
6. Check if the file has been uploaded to the S3 bucket by listing the contents of the bucket:
-> aws s3 ls s3://4demo0608

1. Open the folder where you want to download the file from Amazon S3.
2. Ensure that the file you want to download from S3, in this case, 'data.xlsx,' is available in the specified S3 bucket.
3. Create a Python script named get.py in the same folder and edit the bucket name, file name and s3 key name.

Code:-
import boto3

def download_from_s3(bucket_name, s3_key, file_name):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    
    try:
        s3.download_file(bucket_name, s3_key, file_name)
        print("File download successfully to S3")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")

bucket_name = '5demo0608'
s3_key = 'data.xlsx'
file_name = 'DownloadedData.xlsx'

download_from_s3(bucket_name, s3_key, file_name)

4. Run the Python script.
5. Check if the file has been downloaded or not.

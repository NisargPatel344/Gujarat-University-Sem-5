What are the sequential steps for an employee in an IT company working on a project that involves the following actions:

 Utilizing the get.py file to download data from an S3 bucket.
 Establishing a CodeCommit repository.
 Uploading the get.py file to the created CodeCommit repository.
 Using AWS-CLI to upload a data.csv file to a newly created S3 bucket.
 Performing a Git Clone operation within an EC2 instance.
 Employing the Nano text editor to modify the get.py file by adding the statement print("The task is done").
 Executing the modified get.py file.

Steps :-

 Create a data.csv in the folder:
 Create a new folder.
 Inside the folder, create a file named data.csv.

 Upload the data.csv to S3 Bucket using AWS CLI
 Open the terminal in the folder.
 Execute the following commands:
aws s3 mb s3://csvfolder0608
aws s3 cp ./data.csv s3://csvfolder0608
aws s3 ls s3://csvfolder0608

 Code the get.py file:
 Open the folder and create/get.py file.
 Add the following code to get.py:
import boto3
def download_from_s3(bucket_name, s3_key, file_name):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    try:
        s3.download_file(bucket_name, s3_key, file_name)
        print("File downloaded successfully from S3")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
bucket_name = 'csvfolder0608'
s3_key = 'data.csv'
file_name = 'DownloadedData.csv'
download_from_s3(bucket_name, s3_key, file_name)

 Create a CodeCommit repo:
 Open the terminal in the folder.
 Execute the following commands:
git init
git remote add origin <codecommit HTTPS Link>
git add get.py
git commit -m "-"
git push -u origin master

 Clone CodeCommit Repo in EC2:
 Open the EC2 instance.
 Execute the following command:
git clone <codecommit HTTPS Link>

 Edit and run the get.py:
nano get.py
python3 get.py
ls
